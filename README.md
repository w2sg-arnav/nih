# Overview

This repository contains the complete pipeline for developing RNA-seq based biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The pipeline integrates sample processing, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and machine learning approaches to identify and validate potential biomarkers for ALS diagnosis and progression monitoring.
